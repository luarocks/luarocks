# MD5 - Cryptographic Library for Lua

http://keplerproject.github.io/md5/

MD5 offers basic cryptographic facilities for Lua 5.1: a hash (digest)
function, a pair crypt/decrypt based on MD5 and CFB, and a pair crypt/decrypt based
on DES with 56-bit keys.

MD5 current version is 1.2.

Please check the documentation at /doc/us/ for more information.
