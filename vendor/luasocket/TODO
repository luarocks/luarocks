- document the new bind and connect behavior.
- shouldn't we instead make the code compatible to Lua 5.2
  without any compat stuff, and use a compatibility layer to
  make it work on 5.1?
- add what's new to manual
- should there be an equivalent to tohostname for IPv6?
- should we add service name resolution as well to getaddrinfo?
- Maybe the sockaddr to presentation conversion should be done with getnameinfo()? 

- add http POST sample to manual
  people keep asking stupid questions
- documentation of dirty/getfd/setfd is problematic because of portability
  same for unix and serial.
  what to do about this? add a stronger disclaimer?
- fix makefile with decent defaults?

Done:

- added IPv6 support to getsockname
- simplified getpeername implementation 
- added family to return of getsockname and getpeername
  and added modification to the manual to describe

- connect and bind try all adresses returned by getaddrinfo
- document headers.lua?
- update copyright date everywhere? 
- remove RCSID from files?
- move version to 2.1 rather than 2.1.1?
- fixed url package to support ipv6 hosts 
- changed domain to family
- implement getfamily methods.

- remove references to Lua 5.0 from documentation, add 5.2?
- update lua and luasocket version in samples in documentation
- document ipv5_v6only default option being set?
- document tcp6 and udp6
- document dns.getaddrinfo 
- documented zero-sized datagram change?
  no.
- document unix socket and serial socket? add raw support?
  no.
- document getoption
- merge luaL_typeerror into auxiliar to avoid using luaL prefix? 










replace \r\n with \0xD\0xA in everything
New mime support

ftp send should return server replies?
make sure there are no object files in the distribution tarball
http handling of 100-continue, see DB patch
DB ftp.lua bug.
test unix.c to return just a function and works with require"unix"
get rid of setmetatable(, nil) since packages don't need this anymore in 5.1
compat-5.1 novo
ajeitar pra lua-5.1

adicionar exemplos de expansão: pipe, local, named pipe
testar os options!
