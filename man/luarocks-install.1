.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm luarocks install
installs the rock named
.Ar rock ,
and if specified, version number
.Ar version .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width keyword
.It Fl h
Show a help message and exit.
.It Fl -keep
Do not remove previously installed versions of the rock after building a new one. This behavior can be made permanent by setting keep_other_versions=true in the configuration file.
.It Fl -force
If --keep is not specified, force removal of previously installed versions even if it would break dependencies.
.It Fl -force-fast
Similar to --force, but performs a forced removal without reporting dependency issues.
.It Fl -only-deps , Fl -deps-only
Install only the dependencies of the rock.
.It Fl -no-doc
Install the rock without its documentation.
.It Fl -verify
Verify signature of the rockspec or src.rock being built. If the rockspec or src.rock is being downloaded,
.Sy luarocks
will attempt to download the signature as well. Otherwise, the signature file should be already available locally in the same directory. You need the signerâ€™s public key in your local keyring for this option to work properly.
.It Fl -check-lua-versions
If the rock can't be found, check the repository and report if it is available for another Lua version.
.It Fl -deps-mode Ar mode
Specify how to handle dependencies. Four modes are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Sy all :
use all trees from the rocks_trees list for finding dependencies
.It
.Sy one :
use only the current tree (possibly set with --tree)
.It
.Sy order :
use trees based on order (use the current tree and all trees below it on the rocks_trees list)
.It
.Sy none :
ignore dependencies altogether.
.El
.Pp
The default mode may be set with the deps_mode entry in the configuration file. The current default is
.Ar one .
Run
.Sy luarocks
with no arguments to see your
list of rocks trees.
.It Fl -no-manifest
Skip creating/updating the manifest.
.It Fl -pin
If the installed rock is a Lua module, create a luarocks.lock file listing the exact versions of each dependency found for this rock (recursively), and store it in the rock's directory. Ignores any existing luarocks.lock file in the rock's sources.
.El

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Install version 1.7.0-1 of the
.Sq luafilesystem
rock into the system tree:
.Pp
.Dl # luarocks install luafilesystem 1.7.0-1
