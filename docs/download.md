LuaRocks is a pure Lua application with no library dependencies. Its current
release depends on some helper tools, but you shouldn't worry about them, as
they are shipped by default on most Unix systems. For Windows, the all-in-one
package already includes them and a binary of Lua, as a convenience.

Once LuaRocks is installed, make sure to read the
[Documentation](index.md) for more information!
